Smart Street Light System with Accident Prevention at U-Turns improves road safety and energy efficiency using intelligent lighting control and vehicle detection. The system activates adaptive lights and warning indicators near U-turns to prevent accidents, especially during night and low-visibility conditions..
<br>
<br>
This project presents an IoT-based Smart Street Light System designed to improve energy efficiency and road safety, with special focus on accident prevention at U-turn locations. The system intelligently controls street lighting based on vehicle movement and ambient conditions, reducing unnecessary power consumption during low-traffic periods.
<br>
To enhance safety at U-turns, the system continuously monitors vehicle presence and movement using sensors. When a vehicle approaches or occupies the U-turn zone, warning signals and adaptive lighting are activated to alert oncoming vehicles, improving visibility and reaction time—especially during night and low-visibility conditions.
<br>
The proposed solution aims to minimize road accidents, optimize energy usage, and provide a cost-effective, scalable smart infrastructure model suitable for modern smart cities.
